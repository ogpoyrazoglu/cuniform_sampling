## Overview

This repository is organized into four main directories that each serve a specific purpose in our research.

 - **cuniform_trajectory_sampling**: Contains implementations and scripts related to our trajectory sampling method in [1].
  - **unsupervised_cuniform_trajectory_sampling**: Contains implementations and scripts related to our trajectory sampling method in [2].
- **real_world_ros_implementations**: Provides ROS2 implementations for deploying our algorithms in real-world scenarios.

- **simulations**: Provides simulation environments and configuration files to test and validate our approaches under various conditions.

For detailed information about each folder, please look at readme files in folders.
