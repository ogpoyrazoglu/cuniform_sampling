# C-Uniform Trajectory Sampling

This repository contains the source code for two research papers. 

## Papers

- [**C-Uniform Trajectory Sampling For Fast Motion Planning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12266)
- [**An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05819)


## Overview

It is organized into three main directories that each serve a specific purpose in our research.

 **cuniform_trajectory_sampling**: Contains implementations and scripts related to our trajectory sampling methods.
- **real_world_ros_implementations**: Provides ROS2 implementations for deploying our algorithms in real-world scenarios.
- **simulations**: Provides simulation environments and configuration files to test and validate our approaches under various conditions.

For detailed information about each folder, please look at the readme files in folders.
